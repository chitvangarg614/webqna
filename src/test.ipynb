This technology is set to drive massive progress in the AI world, possibly even more than the next generation of foundation models. Let’s break it down and explore why AI agents are causing such a stir.\\nAndrew NG, recently wrote a series of blogs on Agentic Patterns that underscores the significance of this trend:\\n“Dear friends, I think AI agent workflows will drive massive AI progress this year — perhaps even more than the next generation of foundation models. This is an important trend, and I urge everyone who works in AI to pay attention to it.” — Andrew NG\\nAt their core, AI agents are entities powered by large language models (LLMs) and designed to perform tasks autonomously. Agents can plan, reason, and take action to achieve specific goals. They’re like digital assistants on steroids, capable of breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps, using various tools to accomplish those steps, and learning from their experiences along the way.\\nThe excitement surrounding AI agents stems from their potential to revolutionize how we interact with AI systems and automate complex processes. Imagine having a virtual team member that can not only understand your requests but also devise strategies to fulfill them, adapt to new situations, and even collaborate with other AI agents to tackle multi-faceted problems.\\nWe’ve moved from basic language models that could only inform — “I can tell you about planning a trip to New York” — to today’s AI agents that can act: “I can book your flights, reserve the hotel, and add details to your calendar.” The future promises even more: AI that knows your preferences and takes proactive action without prompting. This progression from information to action to anticipation represents a fundamental shift in how AI will integrate into our lives, transforming from a passive tool to an active, personalized assistant.\\nFrom automating business processes and enhancing customer service to accelerating scientific research and powering creative endeavors, the applications of AI agents are vast and varied. They have the potential to boost productivity, drive innovation, and unlock new possibilities across industries.\\nThis article aims to provide valuable insights for developers seeking to harness AI agent technology, business leaders exploring its potential applications, and individuals interested in understanding the future of artificial intelligence.\\nThis comprehensive guide to AI agents will cover the following topics\\n- The Anatomy of an AI Agent: An examination of the key components that constitute an AI agent, from its LLM core to its planning and action capabilities.\\n- Building Your First AI Agent: A step-by-step tutorial on creating a basic AI agent using Langgraph, focusing on fundamental search functionality.\\n- Advanced Agent Techniques: An exploration of agentic patterns and multi-agent systems that elevate AI capabilities.\\n- Building Multi-Agent System : A step-by-step tutorial on creating a stateful multi-agent AI system using Langgraph\\n- How does Multi-Agent System boost performance: Diving deeper into the agents that Andrew NG and his team build to improve coding eval performance\\n- Challenges and Future Directions: A discussion of the obstacles facing AI agent development and potential future developments in this field.\\nThe Anatomy of an AI Agent\\nAI agents are complex systems composed of several key components that work together to enable autonomous task completion. The anatomy of an AI agent typically consists of five main elements:\\n1. LLM — The Brain\\nAt the core of every AI agent is a Large Language Model (LLM). This serves as the “brain” of the agent, providing the fundamental intelligence and language understanding capabilities. The LLM allows the agent to process and generate human-like text, understand context, and make decisions based on vast amounts of training data.\\n2. Planning — Dividing Objectives into Tasks\\nOne of the critical abilities of an AI agent is its capacity to plan. This component allows the agent to break down complex objectives into a series of manageable tasks. The planning module enables the agent to:\\n- Analyze the given objective\\n- Identify the necessary steps to achieve the goal\\n- Prioritize these steps in a logical sequence\\n- Adapt the plan as new information becomes available\\nEffective planning is crucial for tackling complex, multi-step problems efficiently. In this module, Agents use LLM to reason. This is purely a generative AI task, that effectively be structured as an output as well (see below)\\n{\\n\"task\": \"Generate a Twitter tweet using an AI agent\",\\n\"planning\": {\\n\"inputs\": {\\n\"user_preferences\": [\\n\"topic\",\\n\"keywords\",\\n\"tone\"\\n],\\n\"trending_data\": \"Fetch trending topics or hashtags\"\\n},\\n\"workflow\": [\\n{\\n\"step\": \"Collect Input\",\\n\"description\": \"Gather user preferences and trending data\",\\n\"actions\": [\\n\"Request user input (e.g., topic, keywords, tone)\",\\n\"Fetch trending topics and hashtags from Twitter API\"\\n]\\n},\\n{\\n\"step\": \"Generate Tweet\",\\n\"description\": \"Create a tweet based on input and trends\",\\n\"actions\": [\\n\"Use AI model to generate tweet text within 280 characters\",\\n\"Incorporate user preferences and trending data for relevance\"\\n]\\n},\\n{\\n\"step\": \"Optimize for Engagement\",\\n\"description\": \"Enhance the tweet for better engagement\",\\n\"actions\": [\\n\"Add relevant hashtags and mentions\",\\n\"Adjust tone and content for maximum engagement\"\\n]\\n},\\n{\\n\"step\": \"Validate Tweet\",\\n\"description\": \"Ensure the tweet complies with guidelines\",\\n\"actions\": [\\n\"Check character count and formatting\",\\n\"Ensure content adheres to Twitter\\'s rules and community guidelines\"\\n]\\n},\\n{\\n\"step\": \"Post Tweet\",\\n\"description\": \"Post the tweet on behalf of the user\",\\n\"actions\": [\\n\"Use Twitter API to post the tweet\",\\n\"Confirm tweet has been successfully posted\"\\n]\\n},\\n{\\n\"step\": \"Feedback Loop\",\\n\"description\": \"Collect feedback and improve\",\\n\"actions\": [\\n\"Monitor tweet engagement (likes, retweets, comments)\",\\n\"Adjust AI model based on performance data and user feedback\"\\n]\\n}\\n]\\n}\\n}\\n3. Action — Use of Tools\\nThe action component is where the AI agent interacts with its environment to accomplish tasks. This often involves the use of various tools or APIs. Some examples of actions an AI agent might take include:\\n- Performing web searches\\n- Executing code\\n- Accessing databases\\n- Interacting with other software systems\\nThe ability to use tools effectively greatly expands the range of tasks an AI agent can perform. This is because the paradigm shifts from generative to purely deterministic execution. For example, in a very simple sense, if a agent wants to execute function (e.g. all can API), the objective of the LLM to identify the function to execute and identify the parameters to execute the function. Given below are two APIs\\n## API to post a tweet\\n{\\n\"endpoint\": \"/api/post-tweet\",\\n\"method\": \"POST\",\\n\"description\": \"Post the generated tweet to Twitter.\",\\n\"request\": {\\n\"body\": {\\n\"tweet_id\": \"string\",\\n\"user_id\": \"string\",\\n\"oauth_token\": \"string\"\\n}\\n},\\n\"response\": {\\n\"status\": 200,\\n\"body\": {\\n\"message\": \"Tweet posted successfully.\",\\n\"twitter_post_id\": \"string\"\\n}\\n}\\n}\\n## API to fetch data\\n{\\n\"endpoint\": \"/api/fetch-trending\",\\n\"method\": \"GET\",\\n\"description\": \"Fetch trending topics and hashtags from Twitter.\",\\n\"request\": {\\n\"query_parameters\": {\\n\"location\": \"string\",\\n\"limit\": \"number\"\\n}\\n},\\n\"response\": {\\n\"status\": 200,\\n\"body\": {\\n\"trending_topics\": [\\n{\\n\"hashtag\": \"#example\",\\n\"tweet_volume\": 10000\\n}\\n]\\n}\\n}\\n}\\nNow if I ask an Agent the following\\n\"I want to get some trending topics from Twitter on sports and\\nalso post this tweet to Twitter:\\n\\'AI agents are the greatest innovation since sliced bread\"\\nthe LLM, will identify the following function calls\\n## Make a call to FETCH API with the paramters included\\n{\\n\"endpoint\": \"/api/fetch-trending\",\\n\"method\": \"GET\",\\n\"parameters\": {\\n\"location\": \"global\", // or specific location like \"United States\" to narrow down\\n\"limit\": 10 // Number of trending topics to retrieve\\n},\\n\"response\": {\\n\"status\": 200,\\n\"body\": {\\n\"trending_topics\": [\\n{\\n\"hashtag\": \"#SportsExample1\",\\n\"tweet_volume\": 25000\\n},\\n{\\n\"hashtag\": \"#FootballExample2\",\\n\"tweet_volume\": 18000\\n}\\n// More trending topics...\\n]\\n}\\n}\\n}\\n## Make a call with the POST TWeet API with Params included\\n{\\n\"endpoint\": \"/api/post-tweet\",\\n\"method\": \"POST\",\\n\"body\": {\\n\"tweet_text\": \"AI agents are the best thing that has happened since sliced bread\",\\n\"user_id\": \"your_user_id\", // Unique ID of the user or your app\\n\"oauth_token\": \"your_oauth_token\" // OAuth token to authenticate with Twitter API\\n},\\n\"response\": {\\n\"status\": 200,\\n\"body\": {\\n\"message\": \"Tweet posted successfully.\",\\n\"twitter_post_id\": \"123456789\"\\n}\\n}\\n}\\nOnce you get this output from the LLMs, you can use these to actually execute the APIs in a runtime environment.\\n4. Profile — Describing Agent Behavior\\nThe profile of an AI agent defines its behavior, personality, and specific capabilities. This component might include:\\n- The agent’s role or specialization (e.g., customer service representative, data analyst)\\n- Tone and communication style\\n- Ethical guidelines and constraints\\n- Specific knowledge domains or areas of expertise\\nThe profile helps ensure that the agent’s responses and actions are consistent and appropriate for its intended purpose.\\nSystem Prompt: \"You are a Twitter Content Assistant.\\nYour job is to fetch trending sports topics from Twitter,\\ncreate engaging tweets based on user input,\\nand post them while optimizing for maximum engagement.\"\\n5. Memory — Storing and Recalling Past Interactions\\nThe memory component allows an AI agent to store and recall information from past interactions. This is crucial for:\\n- Maintaining context in ongoing conversations\\n- Learning from previous experiences\\n- Improving performance over time\\n- Providing personalized responses based on user history\\nMemory can be short-term (for the duration of a single conversation) or long-term (persisting across multiple interactions).\\nBuilding Your First AI Agent\\nGiven below is a step-wise instruction on building your first simple AI Agent in Langgraph (https://www.langchain.com/langgraph).\\nThis agent, searches the web for you (if you need to) using tavily (https://tavily.com/)\\n- Install dependencies\\n!pip install -U langchain-community langgraph langchain-anthropic tavily-python langgraph-checkpoint-sqlite\\n!pip install -qU langchain-openai\\n2. Setup Tavily and Open AI and understand tool binding\\nimport getpass\\nimport os\\nos.environ[\"TAVILY_API_KEY\"] = \"\" ##insert Key here\\nfrom langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults\\nsearch = TavilySearchResults(max_results=2)\\nsearch_results = search.invoke(\"what is the weather in SF\")\\nprint(search_results)\\n# If we want, we can create other tools.\\n# Once we have all the tools we want, we can put them in a list that we will reference later.\\ntools = [search]\\nimport getpass\\nimport os\\nos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = \"\"\\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\\nmodel = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4\")\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage\\nresponse = model.invoke([HumanMessage(content=\"hi!\")])\\nresponse.content\\nmodel_with_tools = model.bind_tools(tools) ## here you bind the search tool to LLM\\nresponse = model_with_tools.invoke([HumanMessage(content=\"Hi!\")])\\nprint(f\"ContentString: {response.content}\")\\nprint(f\"ToolCalls: {response.tool_calls}\")\\nresponse = model_with_tools.invoke([HumanMessage(content=\"What\\'s the weather in SF?\")])\\nprint(f\"ContentString: {response.content}\")\\nprint(f\"ToolCalls: {response.tool_calls}\")\\n3. Setup a simple Agent\\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent\\nagent_executor = create_react_agent(model, tools)\\nresponse = agent_executor.invoke({\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=\"hi!\")]})\\nresponse[\"messages\"]\\nresponse = agent_executor.invoke({\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=\"WHAT IS THE WEATHER IN PUNE!\")]})\\nresponse[\"messages\"]\\n4. Add Memory\\nfrom langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver\\nmemory = MemorySaver()\\nagent_executor = create_react_agent(model, tools, checkpointer=memory)\\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"123\"}}\\nfor chunk in agent_executor.stream(\\n{\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=\"hi im bob!\")]}, config\\n):\\nprint(chunk)\\nprint(\"----\")\\nagent_executor = create_react_agent(model, tools, checkpointer=memory)\\nconfig = {\"configurable\": {\"thread_id\": \"123\"}}\\nfor chunk in agent_executor.stream(\\n{\"messages\": [HumanMessage(content=\"hi im bob!\")]}, config\\n):\\nprint(chunk)\\nprint(\"----\")\\nAdvanced Agent Techniques\\nAgentic patterns are the frameworks that guide how AI agents operate and interact. The key patterns identified in current AI research include:\\n1. Reflection\\n2. Tool Use\\n3. Planning\\n4. Multi-Agent Collaboration\\nLet’s delve into each of these patterns to understand their significance in AI development.\\nReflection\\nReflection involves an AI agent’s ability to analyze and critique its own output. This pattern is crucial for improving the quality and reliability of AI-generated content. For instance, in coding tasks, an AI agent might generate code and then review it for correctness, style, and efficiency, offering constructive feedback for improvements.\\nTool Use\\nAI agents are becoming increasingly adept at utilizing external tools to augment their capabilities. This pattern includes:\\n- Web Search: AI agents can now use internet search capabilities to access information beyond their training data, significantly expanding their knowledge base.\\n- Code Execution: Rather than simply reasoning about code, advanced AI agents can write and execute code, allowing for real-world testing and application of their outputs.\\nPlanning\\nLarge language models are now capable of breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps. This planning ability allows AI agents to approach problems methodically, considering the sequence of actions needed to achieve a goal before taking action.\\nMulti-Agent Collaboration\\nPerhaps the most exciting development in AI is the ability for multiple specialized agents to work together on complex tasks. This collaboration mimics human teamwork, with different agents taking on roles similar to those in a professional setting, such as software engineer, product manager, designer, and quality assurance engineer.\\nA Practical Example: Content Creation Pipeline\\nTo illustrate how these agentic patterns come together in a real-world application, let’s consider an automated content creation pipeline:\\n1Agent 1: Video Analysis and Transcription\\n— Task: Find relevant videos on a given topic and generate transcriptions.\\n— Tools: YouTube channel search, video analysis algorithms, transcription software.\\n2. Agent 2: Blog Writing\\n— Task: Create a blog post draft based on the video transcription.\\n3. Agent 3: LinkedIn Post Creation\\n— Task: Craft a LinkedIn post summarizing key points from the blog draft.\\n4. Agent 4: Tweet Composition\\n— Task: Distill the content further into a concise tweet.\\nThis multi-agent system demonstrates how specialized AI agents can work together, each focusing on a specific task while contributing to a larger goal. The process begins with a user’s topic of interest and results in a coordinated content strategy across multiple platforms.\\nBuilding Multi-Agent System\\nGiven below is a standard implementation of a popular use case by Langchain.\\nThis multi-agent system processes a user’s request a through a series of specialized agents: a Researcher gathers data, a Router directs information flow, a Chart Generator creates visuals, and a Call_tool facilitates agent interactions. The system cycles through these agents, guided by conditional logic, until the final chart is produced and returned to the user.\\nStep-1: Install Dependencies\\npip install -U langchain langchain_openai langsmith pandas langchain_experimental matplotlib langgraph langchain_core\\nStep-2: Create a function to generate agents\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import (\\nBaseMessage,\\nHumanMessage,\\nToolMessage,\\n)\\nfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder\\nfrom langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph, START\\ndef create_agent(llm, tools, system_message: str):\\n\"\"\"Create an agent.\"\"\"\\nprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(\\n[\\n(\\n\"system\",\\n\"You are a helpful AI assistant, collaborating with other assistants.\"\\n\" Use the provided tools to progress towards answering the question.\"\\n\" If you are unable to fully answer, that\\'s OK, another assistant with different tools \"\\n\" will help where you left off. Execute what you can to make progress.\"\\n\" If you or any of the other assistants have the final answer or deliverable,\"\\n\" prefix your response with FINAL ANSWER so the team knows to stop.\"\\n\" You have access to the following tools: {tool_names}.\\\\n{system_message}\",\\n),\\nMessagesPlaceholder(variable_name=\"messages\"),\\n]\\n)\\nprompt = prompt.partial(system_message=system_message)\\nprompt = prompt.partial(tool_names=\", \".join([tool.name for tool in tools]))\\nreturn prompt | llm.bind_tools(tools)\\nThis function is a generic function to create all of the above agents. But we do not have to limit creation of the agents to a single function at all. They can have their own tools, their specific prompts. The above function creates an agent given a set of tools (that binds to llm) and a system description\\nStep-3: Add the tools\\nfrom typing import Annotated\\nfrom langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults\\nfrom langchain_core.tools import tool\\nfrom langchain_experimental.utilities import PythonREPL\\ntavily_tool = TavilySearchResults(max_results=5)\\n# Warning: This executes code locally, which can be unsafe when not sandboxed\\nrepl = PythonREPL()\\n@tool\\ndef python_repl(\\ncode: Annotated[str, \"The python code to execute to generate your chart.\"],\\n):\\n\"\"\"Use this to execute python code. If you want to see the output of a value,\\nyou should print it out with `print(...)`. This is visible to the user.\"\"\"\\ntry:\\nresult = repl.run(code)\\nexcept BaseException as e:\\nreturn f\"Failed to execute. Error: {repr(e)}\"\\nresult_str = f\"Successfully executed:\\\\n```python\\\\n{code}\\\\n```\\\\nStdout: {result}\"\\nreturn (\\nresult_str + \"\\\\n\\\\nIf you have completed all tasks, respond with FINAL ANSWER.\")\\nWe have two tools above —\\n- Tavily (like in the example above) for a search functionality.\\n- The second tool is a python runtime function to execute generation of a code — The function takes a python code and executes it.\\nStep-4: Create an Agent State\\nWhen we talk about these agents, we talk about Stateful Agents\\nStateful AI agents utilize persistent memory structures to retain and update contextual information across interactions, enabling dynamic adaptation of their decision-making processes. This architecture facilitates complex reasoning, supports long-term dependencies in sequential tasks, and allows for more sophisticated pattern recognition and personalized responses in applications ranging from conversational interfaces to multi-step problem-solving scenarios.\\nBelow, we create a state structure that is maintained and updated throughout the cycles.\\nimport operator\\nfrom typing import Annotated, Sequence, TypedDict\\nfrom langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\\n# This defines the object that is passed between each node\\n# in the graph. We will create different nodes for each agent and tool\\nclass AgentState(TypedDict):\\nmessages: Annotated[Sequence[BaseMessage], operator.add]\\nsender: str\\nthe messages variable keeps getting appended with new messages, whereas the sender variable gets substituted (this essentially is leveraged by the current agent to understand who the previous agent was)\\nStep-5: Define the agents\\nWe create 3 agents or nodes in the graph\\n1. research_agent: That is responsible for searching the web and gathering information for the chart_agent\\n2. chart_agent: That is responsible for generating and executing python codes and generating charts\\n3. Tool_node: That is responsible for just executing various tools\\nimport functools\\nfrom langchain_core.messages import AIMessage\\n# Helper function to create a node for a given agent\\ndef agent_node(state, agent, name):\\nresult = agent.invoke(state)\\n# We convert the agent output into a format that is suitable to append to the global state\\nif isinstance(result, ToolMessage):\\npass\\nelse:\\nresult = AIMessage(**result.dict(exclude={\"type\", \"name\"}), name=name)\\nreturn {\\n\"messages\": [result],\\n# Since we have a strict workflow, we can\\n# track the sender so we know who to pass to next.\\n\"sender\": name,\\n}\\nllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")\\n# Research agent and node\\nresearch_agent = create_agent(\\nllm,\\n[tavily_tool],\\nsystem_message=\"You should provide accurate data for the chart_generator to use.\",\\n)\\nresearch_node = functools.partial(agent_node, agent=research_agent, name=\"Researcher\")\\n# chart_generator\\nchart_agent = create_agent(\\nllm,\\n[python_repl],\\nsystem_message=\"Any charts you display will be visible by the user.\",\\n)\\nchart_node = functools.partial(agent_node, agent=chart_agent, name=\"chart_generator\")\\nfrom langgraph.prebuilt import ToolNode\\ntools = [tavily_tool, python_repl]\\ntool_node = ToolNode(tools)\\nStep-6: Define the conditional edges / logic\\n# Either agent can decide to end\\nfrom typing import Literal\\ndef router(state) -> Literal[\"call_tool\", \"__end__\", \"continue\"]:\\n# This is the router\\nmessages = state[\"messages\"]\\nlast_message = messages[-1]\\nif last_message.tool_calls:\\n# The previous agent is invoking a tool\\nreturn \"call_tool\"\\nif \"FINAL ANSWER\" in last_message.content:\\n# Any agent decided the work is done\\nreturn \"__end__\"\\nreturn \"continue\"\\nThis function essentially means that\\n- If the previous agent is invoking a tool (that is binding to the agent’s llm) then it will update the state to a tool call\\n- If the previous agent is not invoking a tool call, but is suggesting that its done its job and the final answer is ready, it will update the state to END\\n- Else, it will update the state to continue\\nStep-7: We define this graph\\nworkflow = StateGraph(AgentState)\\nworkflow.add_node(\"Researcher\", research_node)\\nworkflow.add_node(\"chart_generator\", chart_node)\\nworkflow.add_node(\"call_tool\", tool_node)\\nworkflow.add_conditional_edges(\\n\"Researcher\",\\nrouter,\\n{\"continue\": \"chart_generator\", \"call_tool\": \"call_tool\", \"__end__\": END},\\n)\\nworkflow.add_conditional_edges(\\n\"chart_generator\",\\nrouter,\\n{\"continue\": \"Researcher\", \"call_tool\": \"call_tool\", \"__end__\": END},\\n)\\nworkflow.add_conditional_edges(\\n\"call_tool\",\\n# Each agent node updates the \\'sender\\' field\\n# the tool calling node does not, meaning\\n# this edge will route back to the original agent\\n# who invoked the tool\\nlambda x: x[\"sender\"],\\n{\\n\"Researcher\": \"Researcher\",\\n\"chart_generator\": \"chart_generator\",\\n},\\n)\\nworkflow.add_edge(START, \"Researcher\")\\ngraph = workflow.compile()\\nNow this the core bit — we create a graph, and add the 3 nodes (agents). We then add edges with conditions (based on the router function defined in step-6)\\n- Edge added from the researcher node:\\n— If the router says (step-6) the state needs to be updated to continue, it will proceed to chart_generator.\\n— If the router says the state needs to be updated to call_tool, it will proceed towards tool agent.\\n— If the router says the state needs to be updated to END, the whole execution will stop - Edge added from the chart_generator node:\\n— If the router says the state needs to be updated to continue, it will proceed to researcher.\\n— If the router says the state needs to be updated to call_tool, it will proceed towards tool agent.\\n— If the router says the state needs to be updated to END, the whole execution will stop - Edge added from the tool node: It will go back to the sender (the state before tool node was executed) based on the sender variable in the state\\nWe start the execution from the researcher, and then proceed.\\nworkflow.add_edge(START, \"Researcher\")\\ngraph = workflow.compile()\\nYou can also understand the graph build visually as follows\\nfrom IPython.display import Image, display\\ntry:\\ndisplay(Image(graph.get_graph(xray=True).draw_mermaid_png()))\\nexcept Exception:\\n# This requires some extra dependencies and is optional\\npass\\nStep-8: Execute the agentic system\\nevents = graph.stream(\\n{\\n\"messages\": [\\nHumanMessage(\\ncontent=\"Fetch India\\'s GDP for past 5 years and plot a chart of it\"\\n)\\n],\\n},\\n# Maximum number of steps to take in the graph\\n{\"recursion_limit\": 150},\\n)\\nfor s in events:\\nprint(s)\\nprint(\"----\")\\nHere is the output\\n{\\'Researcher\\': {\\'messages\\': [AIMessage(content=\\'\\', additional_kwargs={\\'tool_calls\\': [{\\'id\\': \\'call_j7HkP2IDb5H37J19476mCjXu\\', \\'function\\': {\\'arguments\\': \\'{\"query\":\"India GDP past 5 years\"}\\', \\'name\\': \\'tavily_search_results_json\\'}, \\'type\\': \\'function\\'}], \\'refusal\\': None}, response_metadata={\\'token_usage\\': {\\'completion_tokens\\': 23, \\'prompt_tokens\\': 204, \\'total_tokens\\': 227}, \\'model_name\\': \\'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18\\', \\'system_fingerprint\\': \\'fp_48196bc67a\\', \\'finish_reason\\': \\'tool_calls\\', \\'logprobs\\': None}, name=\\'Researcher\\', id=\\'run-9c6fb317-dd89-48fd-bc4e-8375e2de383f-0\\', tool_calls=[{\\'name\\': \\'tavily_search_results_json\\', \\'args\\': {\\'query\\': \\'India GDP past 5 years\\'}, \\'id\\': \\'call_j7HkP2IDb5H37J19476mCjXu\\', \\'type\\': \\'tool_call\\'}], usage_metadata={\\'input_tokens\\': 204, \\'output_tokens\\': 23, \\'total_tokens\\': 227})], \\'sender\\': \\'Researcher\\'}}\\n----\\n{\\'call_tool\\': {\\'messages\\': [ToolMessage(content=\\'[{\"url\": \"https://tradingeconomics.com/india/gdp-growth-annual\", \"content\": \"GDP Annual Growth Rate in India averaged 5.93 percent from 1951 until 2023, reaching an all time high of 21.60 percent in the second quarter of 2021 and a record low of -23.40 percent in the second quarter of 2020.

Manual Chart Suggestion: Based on the search results, the Researcher suggests using online graph makers and provides steps for manual chart creation.\\n6. Transition to Code-Based Approach: The chart_generator agent takes over, deciding to use Python code to create the chart.\\n7.

GPT-4 (zero shot) does better at 67.0%. However, the improvement from GPT-3.5 to GPT-4 is dwarfed by incorporating an iterative agent workflow. Wrapped in an agent loop, GPT-3.5 achieves up to 95.1% and GPT-4 achieves 97%\\nAs you can see from the image above, for GPT-4, using tools, the performance increases from 67% to about 83% and using planning agent, it shoots up to 97%. This shows the impact of Agentic patterns and multi-agent systems.\\nThe best part — The LLM is the same. No new foundation model or fine-tuning or any other training\\nChallenges and Future Directions\\nChallenges of AI Agents (especially multi-agent architectures)\\n1. Scalability: As AI agents become more complex and are deployed in larger systems, ensuring they can scale efficiently becomes crucial. This involves optimizing computational resources, managing distributed systems, and handling increased data volumes without compromising performance. If you have 4–5 agents executing a task that earlier was a single LLM call, despite increase in performance, your TPMs and RPMs (tokens per minute and requests per minute) are increased by 4–5X. This issue is further complicated if your input prompt is really large.\\nThere is a huge tradeoff between performance and scale.\\n2. Integrations: To make AI-agents truly end-to-end, you still need to seamlessly integrating AI agents with existing software ecosystems, APIs, and data sources. This can be a fairly complicated process, and has not yet fully seen the benefits of generative AI in terms of acceleration\\n3. Deterministic vs Stochastic Behavior: Balancing deterministic (predictable) and stochastic (probabilistic) behaviors in AI agents is key. AI agents are highly effective in deterministic environments where outcomes are predictable and can be consistently replicated. Deterministic behavior ensures consistency and reliability, making these agents ideal for tasks that require exact results, such as automated trading systems or quality control processes. This reliability is crucial in scenarios where compliance with specific standards is mandatory. Furthermore, deterministic behavior helps reduce errors by adhering to predefined rules and algorithms, thereby minimizing unexpected outcomes. This predictability enhances efficiency, allowing AI agents to perform repetitive tasks swiftly and cost-effectively. It also enables developers to fine-tune the system to meet precise performance benchmarks. In deterministic settings, AI agents offer greater control over their actions, which is essential for complex systems requiring precise behavior. By focusing on deterministic processes, AI systems can deliver high levels of accuracy and operational efficiency, ensuring that tasks are completed reliably and within desired parameters.\\n4. Short-term Memory Limitations: Current AI models often struggle with maintaining context over extended interactions. Developing efficient methods for short-term memory retention and retrieval is critical for creating more coherent and contextually aware agents.\\n5. Security: Protecting AI agents from adversarial attacks, ensuring data privacy, and maintaining ethical use of information are paramount. Implementing robust security measures without compromising functionality is a significant technical challenge.\\n6. End-to-End Agent Ops: In complex multi-agent systems, managing an increasing number of agents and steps makes it challenging to pinpoint failures and identify under performing agents. As the system grows, tracking individual agent performance becomes more difficult due to the sheer volume of interactions and dependencies between agents. Each agent’s performance affects others, and with more agents involved, it’s harder to isolate specific points of failure.Understanding which agent is failing or under performing requires sophisticated monitoring and diagnostic tools. The complexity increases because failures can be indirect, where one agent’s issue impacts the entire system in subtle ways. Identifying the root cause involves analyzing a larger network of interactions and dependencies, making it harder to diagnose and address performance problems effectively. Ultimately, the complexity of managing and analyzing performance in a multi-agent system grows with the number of agents and steps, necessitating advanced tools and methods to accurately detect and resolve issues.\\nConclusion\\nThe future of AI agents is incredibly promising, with the potential to transform our interactions with technology by making it more intuitive, efficient, and proactive. However, this evolution comes with significant challenges. Ensuring that AI agents operate with high reliability, ethical considerations, and transparency will be crucial to gaining user trust and achieving widespread adoption. Technical hurdles such as improving decision-making capabilities, managing complex multi-agent systems, and addressing issues of bias and privacy are key areas that need attention. As we advance, navigating these challenges while harnessing the full potential of AI agents will be essential for realizing their transformative impact and integrating them seamlessly into our lives.\\nSome recommended articles that you must checkout\\n- Prosus on Agent Ops — https://www.prosus.com/news-insights/group-updates/2024/ai-agentops-landscape\\n- Lang-fuse for Langgraphs — https://langfuse.com/docs/integrations/langchain/example-python-langgraph\\n- Andrew NG’s articles\\n— https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/how-agents-can-improve-llm-performance/\\n— https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/agentic-design-patterns-part-2-reflection/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\\n— https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/agentic-design-patterns-part-3-tool-use/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\\n— https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/agentic-design-patterns-part-4-planning/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io\\n— https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/agentic-design-patterns-part-5-multi-agent-collaboration/?ref=dl-staging-website.ghost.io')]"
